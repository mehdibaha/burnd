# Burnd (burnd.cles-facil.fr/index.html)

Burnd can be used in different kinds of celebrations and private gatherings to bring together hundreds of people.

Our app aims to introduce a new type of communication in these situations, not by obstructing human contact, but rather by enhancing it.

# Start the app
- You're first introduced to a tutorial explaining to you how to use our app.
- You can then connect to Burnd with Facebook.

# Join or create a party
- To join a party, you can search for parties near you, or you can enter its name+pass directly.
- To create one, there is a form specifying the information of the party to create (name, pass, location, etc.).

# Inside your party
Once you join a party, you have access to several services :
- The main one being the newsfeed bringing together photos, videos and posts of all kinds of other "partiers".
- You may even meet some new people there, by liking/disliking people in your party.
- The innovative aspect of this application is that the entire party is completely deleted the next day.
